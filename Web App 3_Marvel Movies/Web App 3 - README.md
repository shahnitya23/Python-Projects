# How Much Money do Marvel Movie Distributors Make?

With the new Spiderman movie (No Way Home) being the talk of the town, I started to wonder how much revenue Marvel Movies make. They must make a lot! So I decided to 
dive deeper into this to visualize how much Marvel Movie distributors make.

## Solution

To visualize how much Marvel Movie distributors make, I used Python and Justpy, and Pandas libraries. I was able to make interactive graphs on how many Marvel movies 
each of the distributor's distributed, how much money these distributors on average made in the opening week of the movies, and the revenue they generate in North 
America, Territories, and the World. This project was also great in helping me get more comfortable with the Python Pandas library specifically.
