Problem:

Trying fit all your projects, interests, and work experiences into a page or two sometimes feels like an impossible task. Not only that but also being descriptive 
enough for the individual reading your resume to understand how I had contributed and what I learned from those experiences is a difficult task. A sentence 
sometimes does not do it justice. Plus, there arenâ€™t even any pictures to showcase my work on those pages!

Solution: 

To resolve this issue, I decided to create my portfolio web application using Python and Flask. I was able to present myself in a better format, and organize 
my clubs, projects, and experiences in a better way. I also added pictures and links to help with this!
