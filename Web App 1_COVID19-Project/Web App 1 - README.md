# COVID-19  Distribution Map

Communicating information visually allows individuals to better retention of information, as it can bring clarity to oral communication, make it more interactive, and 
present complex ideas/ concepts in an easier format. 

# Problem: 

With the COVID-19 pandemic, every day there are different numbers thrown around associated with the number of active COVID-19 cases in a country, the number of deaths in 
a country, and the number of vaccinations administered in a country. Not only this but some of the countries being discussed were countries I had very minimal knowledge 
about (both geographically and functionally)!

# Solution: 

To resolve this issue, I made a web app using Python and pandas and folium libraries to help with the visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic. By making this map, my 
friends, family, and I were able to better visualize and understand the spread of COVID-19 globally and simultaneously learn more about the countries around the globe. 
The map I created shows the total population of each country (as of 2005), the total number of COVID-19 cases in each country, total deaths due to the virus in each 
country, the total number of vaccinations administered in each country, the total number of fully vaccinated individuals in each country, a vaccination status based of 
the ratio of the total number of vaccinations administered and the total number of fully vaccinated individuals in each country, and a link to the countries Google page. 
Some of these variables also have been color-coded to show their severity.

# Future Changes:

As of now, the data the script extracts is from a static Excel file. I could use the knowledge I have in VBA Coding and/or learn how to web scrap using Python to make 
this a dynamic Excel file, that updates the information every day or week.
