# Webcam and Object Detection

With rapidly advancing technologies up and coming every day, facial recognition/ object detection has become a big thing. In fact, a while back I was reading how in 
some places of the world (ie, China, Japan, etc.) they are transitioning towards using face detection in public areas (eg. public transportation, etc.) to identify 
individuals of their community, or who are jaywalking or committing a crime. I found this so interesting, and see this to be a big thing in the near future.

## Solution: 

To get a taste of how this works in the real world, I thought of simulating something similar using Python and OpenCV, and Pandas libraries. The program I have created 
is able to detect and highlight the moving object on the screen and is able to graph the duration of time for each it appeared on the screen for.
