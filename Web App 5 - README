Problem: 

During the pandemic, I have started reading more books and have really been enjoying it! The list of books I have finished reading is quickly adding up, and I 
wanted to keep track of them. Not only this but I hope by having this list I will be encouraged to read more books/ short stories. Currently, there are some 
apps that track the books you have read, however, I wanted to create my own application!

Solution:

Using Python, the libraries Tkinter, and SQLite (SQLite is a server-less database), I was able to create my own book tracker - which keeps track of the books I 
have already read/ want to read in the future. I created my own GUI to act as an interface and connected it to a database, which stored the bookâ€™s data.
