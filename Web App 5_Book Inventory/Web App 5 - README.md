# Book Tracker Inventory Management

A way to keep track of the books you read or the books you want to read in the future.

## Problem: 

During the pandemic, I have started reading more books and have been enjoying it! The list of books I have finished reading is quickly adding up, and I wanted 
to keep track of them. Not only this but I hope by having this list I will be encouraged to read more books/ short stories. Currently, some apps track the books 
you have read, however, I wanted to create my own application!

## Solution:

Using Python, the libraries Tkinter, and SQLite (SQLite is a server-less database), I was able to create my own book tracker - which keeps track of the books I 
have already read/ want to read in the future. I created my own GUI to act as an interface and connected it to a database, which stored the bookâ€™s data. I also 
converted it to an executable file, so that anyone can use it on their computer without having Python installed (under the dist folder)!
